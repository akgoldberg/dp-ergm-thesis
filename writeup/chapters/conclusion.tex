Future Work:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Synthetic data??? Low KL-divergence suggests that drawing data using the parameters we learned maintain structure of the original network. Currently, graphs are drawn from non-private learned parameters to provide privacy for network data indicating that this is a promising approach for releasing synthetic networks, but systematic study is needed.
	\item Testing node-level privacy on larger networks.
	\item Adapting more scalable inference methods to take into account the privacy mechanism. To date, Karwa et. al has proposed MLE estimation and we use Bayesian inference, but there are much more efficinet methods based on correcting a pseudo-posterior --> could these be used (scalability would be very helpful here) 
	\item Directed networks.
\end{enumerate}
